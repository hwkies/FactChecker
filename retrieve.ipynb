       "  'text': 'A leading autism advocacy organization, Autism Speaks, is urging parents to vaccinate their children amid a measles outbreak that has swept 14 states. As some\\xa0continue to cite unfounded fears that vaccinations can lead to autism, Autism Speaks chief science officer Rob Ring has released a statement saying vaccinations cannot cause the disorder — and telling parents to vaccinate their children. “Over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism,” he said late last week in a brief statement. “The results of this research are clear: Vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Autism Speaks, a nonprofit organization that promotes autism awareness and sponsors research in the field, has stated its policy on vaccinations before, but perhaps never so plainly as now. In the past, the organization, which funded research into possible connections between immunizations and autism, has said it is possible that, in rare cases, “immunization may trigger the onset of autism symptoms in a child with an underlying medical or genetic condition” — while pointing out that “studies have not found a link between vaccines and autism.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Fears about vaccination were bolstered by a bogus study that claimed to show a link between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. The now- discredited study was published in 1998 by British doctor Andrew Wakefield in an esteemed medical journal, the Lancet. The journal later retracted the study, and Wakefield lost his medical license. But his research is still touted as true by some who refuse to vaccinate.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico In 2011, Autism Speaks was one of the sponsors of a National Autism Association event at which Wakefield was a speaker. Nevertheless, over the years, the organization has made its policy on the immunization issue clear: Vaccinate your kids. For example, in May 2014, Autism Speaks linked to a report on its Web site that showed vaccinations do not cause autism.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico “This analysis provides further confirmation for a lack of association between vaccines and autism that the broader health-care community has understood and embraced for some time,” Ring said last year about the findings. “Autism Speaks’ own policy on vaccines echoes those of other credible health-care organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization. We strongly encourage parents to work with their physician to ensure their children receive the full benefits immunization offers in protecting their loved ones against a variety of preventable childhood diseases.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The organization was not immediately available for comment. All states permit parents to choose not to vaccinate children for legitimate medical reasons such as anaphylactic allergic response, a life-threatening reaction. And many allow them to opt-out for religious or personal beliefs. But non-medical exemptions have come under scrutiny since a measles outbreak in California’s Disneyland swept the country. Last month, 102 people from 14 states were reported to be infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Since then, doctors have spoken out about the anti-vaccine movement. Some have refused to see patients who refuse their immunizations. Los Angeles pediatrician Charles Goodman posted a notice in his waiting room last month: He would no longer treat children whose parents won’t\\xa0get them vaccinated. “Parents who choose not to give measles shots, they’re not just putting their kids at risk, but they’re also putting other kids at risk — especially kids in my waiting room,” he said, according to the Associated Press.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Medical experts have said those who are not vaccinated pose a risk to those who cannot be vaccinated because they have legitimate medical reasons or because they are too young. Children cannot get their MMR vaccine until they are 12 months old. Harry Gewanter, a doctor in Richmond, said it’s parents’ responsibility to vaccinate. “I’ve seen the horror stories of what happens from these diseases and now this generation of doctors have never seen them because of immunization practices,” he said, according to WWBT-TV. “One out of a thousand people infected with measles dies. And just because we haven’t seen it doesn’t mean it’s not coming.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **RELATED:Why this baby’s mom is so angry at the anti-vaxxers**    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **RELATED:Amid measles outbreak, anti-vaccine doctor revels in his notoriety**    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **RELATED:The Disneyland measles outbreak and the disgraced doctor who whipped up vaccination fear**    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico **RELATED:Parents with doubts about vaccinations face backlash from pediatricians, peers**    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico',\n",

       "  'text': 'The whole vaccine mess, in the United States and abroad, is a story of allowing anecdotes to trump statistical reasoning. Some parents who saw their children get their shots, and then tragically saw them develop autism, inferred a causal relationship that wasn’t there. Fortunately, we have science to correct such errors, and in this case, science has done that.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico But there’s another error of anecdotal reasoning here — not about vaccinations and the development of autism, but rather about a perceived correlation between leftwing, hippie-types and vaccine distrust. And thus was born another myth — that denying vaccine safety, or avoiding vaccinations, is a liberal, granola thing. That’s the myth that began to shatter on Monday, when libertarian leaning senator and possible presidential contender Rand Paul said some truly alarming things about vaccines — suggesting they should be voluntary in many cases, and citing “many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.”** (Don’t worry, I’m not only using the anecdote of Rand Paul to make this point. Stand by for the data.)    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The truth is, the idea that vaccine skepticism lies on the political left never stood up to statistical scrutiny. I won’t belabor this point, since I’ve made it before, but this chart from Yale’s Dan Kahan says it all — while many beliefs change as you move from the left to the right of the political spectrum, doubts about vaccine safety really don’t move much, and if anything, _increase_ slightly as you move to the right:    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico This suggests that political ideology is not the chief factor that predicts how a person feels about the safety of childhood vaccines. And indeed, we know that a much better predictor is being a conspiracy theorist, and holding beliefs like these: “The Apollo Moon landings never happened and were staged in a Hollywood studio” and “The assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., was the result of an organized conspiracy by U.S. government agencies such as the CIA and FBI.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Nonetheless, there is a relatively weak correlation in the figure above between political conservatism and an increased distrust of vaccines. But that probably shouldn’t be taken at face value, in light of other research suggesting that the association is really only with one branch of the complicated stew that we call American conservatism — namely, with libertarians or free market believers.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico Indeed, a new study suggests that in 2009, in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) scare, people who were less trusting of government were also less likely to get a swine flu vaccine.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico All of this suggests that there may be an important tie between libertarian thinking — which puts great emphasis on preserving individual liberties from government intrusions — and doubts about government-required vaccinations. You don’t have to listen to Rand Paul to discern that; you can also get a taste by going over and reading _Reason_ magazine, which hosted a 2014 debate over vaccinations that began with the observation, “Few issues divide libertarians so emphatically as government-mandated vaccinations against communicable diseases.”    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico The key word here, though, is “divide.” Even if there’s a strain in the community that doesn’t want the government telling them to vaccinate their kids, not all libertarians are against requiring vaccinations. Sure enough, in the _Reason_ debate, science correspondent Ronald Bailey valiantly defends vaccines against their critics, and does so from a libertarian perspective. For after all, everybody’s freedom has limits — and those limits are most clear when it comes to causing harm to others.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico To this effect, Bailey quotes Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ observation that “The right to swing my fist ends where the other man’s nose begins,” and then goes on to note:\\xa0“People who refuse vaccination are asserting that they have a right to ‘swing’ their microbes at other people. That is wrong.” Right now, with Rand Paul — and to a lesser extent, Chris Christie — pushing certain buttons that potentially yoke together required vaccinations and government intrusions in the minds of conservatives, we badly need those on the right to read and heed someone like Bailey — who just called Paul out in a blog post.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico That is, before the vaccine issue tips over into truly dangerous partisanship. ** **Update:** Later on Tuesday, Rand Paul tweeted a picture of himself getting vaccinated and said his views had been mischaracterized by the “liberal media.” If Paul does think vaccines are safe after all, that’s great to hear. The fact remains that concern about vaccines exists on the libertarian right, as well as on the left.    *[WSU]: Wayne State University   *[Tue]: Tuesday   *[Wed]: Wednesday   *[UNM]: University of New Mexico',\n",
